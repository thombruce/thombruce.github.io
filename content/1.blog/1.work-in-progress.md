# Work in Progress

Rebuilding website from scratch... -ish. Be right back!

## This is a draft

Should we be numbering blog files? E.g. `1.work-in-progress.md`? I don't think it makes sense... since they could end up being published out of order relative to creation.

Without numbering though, they are not as easily ordered. Could use year/month subfolders? This would result in paths like:

```sh
/blog/2024/07/work-in-progress
/blog/2024/Jul/work-in-progress
# Of these, I prefer the first.
```

Subpages for the date partials then might have to exist...

```sh
/blog
/blog/2024
/blog/2024/07
```

Each of those would have more and more reduced content lists...

...but honestly, I think I prefer to do without the date part. Might explore that in a separate project... maybe the TNT blog? ...which should have updates/release notes.
