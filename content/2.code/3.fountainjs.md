# FountainJS

_FountainJS_ is a JavaScript parser for the [Fountain](https://fountain.io/) screenplay markup syntax.

You can see the format in action (while checking out some of my old screenplays) here: [my screenplays](/screenplays).

Check out _FountainJS_ for yourself here: [:icon{name="fa-brands:github"} thombruce/FountainJS](https://github.com/thombruce/FountainJS)
