# FountainJS

_FountainJS_ is an open source project I inherited out of a want to display my old screenplays on my website. It's a JavaScript parser for the [Fountain screenplay markup syntax](https://fountain.io/). You can check out the fruits of my effort (and my old screenplays) here: [my screenplays](/screenplays).
