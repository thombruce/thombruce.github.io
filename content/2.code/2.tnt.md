# TNT

TNT (or _Thom's Nuxt Template_) is the Nuxt layer system this site is built on. _What is a "Nuxt layer system"?_, you may ask. It's a nifty feature of the Nuxt JavaScript framework which allows me to separate the responsibilities of my website framework into independent layers. In the case of TNT, there are currently two layers:

1. _TNT Core_
2. _TNT Content_

_TNT Core_ houses the core UI and a collection of general purpose components that can be used and reused on any kind of website. _TNT Content_ meanwhile is a content-focused template for sites like this one; it extends and adds to the collection of components offered by _TNT Core_ to provide compatibility with [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com).
