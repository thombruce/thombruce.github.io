# Strive

:breadcrumbs

[//]: # (TODO: Would be an expansion on a todo app, with an emphasis on longer term goals. A goal could have smaller objectives, each of those could have a checklist... date targets could be set, some goals/objectives could be listed as blockers or prerequisites for others.)

[//]: # (The name Strive came to me first, the Conquer, then Conker in case those were taken. But I do like the name Conker a lot - it doesn't really explain what the app is, but neither does Idle, Toodles or Oggi and it's a fun name.)

[//]: # (Strive already exists as a "Group Fitness App" and as a "Employee Experience App".)

[//]: # (Conquer already exists as a local sports app for finding games/clubs.)

[//]: # (Conker already exists as a AI powered quiz app.)

[//]: # (My app would fit a different domain than any of these, so technically the use of any name should be fine. But Conker was on Skark Tank and has a lot of momentum - of the three names, it's the most confusing and the most likely to be confused.)

[//]: # (Suggest a name like: Strive - Goal Tracker)
